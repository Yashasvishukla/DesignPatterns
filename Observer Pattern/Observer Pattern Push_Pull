Normally we have 

            Push data
Subject  -------------> Oberser

Advantages:
1. Subject just need to know about the Observer and notify the observers with the State on the State change. 

Disadvantages:
1. If there is any modification to state of subject we might end up modifying all the observers update implementation. 
2. The Subject will push every thing because it doesn't know what the observer wants particularly. (May end up with pushing extra information)

What if
              Pulls data
Subject <---------------------- Observer

Instead of subject pushing the data what if the observers pulls the data when they want
and more importantly they will pull the data that they require instead of pulling everything.

There’s so many different
kinds of us Observers, there’s no way we can
anticipate everything we need. Just let us come
to you to get the state we need. That way, if
some of us only need a little bit of state, we
aren’t forced to get it all.


It also makes things
easier to modify later. Say, for example, you
expand yourself and add some more state, well
if you use pull, you don’t have to go around
and change the update calls on every observer,
you just need to change yourself to allow more
getter methods to access our additional state.
