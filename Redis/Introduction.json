Redis is an open source, In memory data structure store used as 
1. database
2. cache
3. message broker
4. streaming engine.

Redis provides the data structure such as 
1. strings
2. hashes
3. lists
4. sets
5. sorted sets with range queries
6. bitmaps
7. LUA scripting
8. LRU eviction
9. transaction
10. different level of **On-Disk persitence**


Redis also supports atomic operations on the types like
1. appending to a string
2. incrementing the value in a hash
3. pushing elements to a list
4. computing a set intersection, union and difference
5. getting member with highest ranking in a sorted set.


Redis works as an in-memory dataset. Depending on the use case
1. It can persist the data either by periodically dumping the dataset to disk
2. by appending each command to a disk based log.

We can also disable persistence if we jsut need a feature-rich, networked, in-memory cache





Redis also supports asynchronous replication. ----------> Read about it in more detail


Redis also includes
1. Transaction
2. Pub/Sub
3. LUA scripting
4. Key with limited time to live
5. LRU eviction of keys
6. Automatic failover
